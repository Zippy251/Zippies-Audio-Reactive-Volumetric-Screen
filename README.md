# Zippies-Audio-Reactive-Volumetric-Screen
i kept seeing volumetric screens like this in worlds but the creators kept gate keeping them so i made my own with the help of Claude.

Instructions for use
1) Put the plane in your scene and place it where you want/scale it to the size you want. You can also use other custom-shaped planes if you wish, just make sure there are plenty of vertices. 
2) Assign the Volumetric Material to the plane
3) Assign a render texture to the Volumetric Material (it does not need to be the one included in the package)
4) Profit
5) play bad apple on it
